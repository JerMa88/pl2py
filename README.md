# pl2py
A simple package that translates Perl code into Python line by line. 

This package is designed to take typical, not-too-terse Perl 5 code and convert to its Python equivalent. Since both functions are interpreted language that support precedual programming, the similarities between both languages entice a project to convert the first postmodern programming language, Perl, into a more modern and more widely-adopted language, Python.

Perl code is somewhat different than most programs developed in Python. Perl is a scripting language for the unix-like systems that focuses on [regular expression (regex)](https://regex101.com/), hence the unofficial backronym: ["Practical Extraction and Reporting Language"](https://linux.die.net/man/1/perl).

This project was initiated for my nesseccity of developing a more modern version of the [TAO package](https://s2.smu.edu/ptao/software/taopackage/TAOpackage.html), tasked by [Dr. Peng Tao](https://www.smu.edu/dedman/academics/departments/chemistry/people/faculty/pengtao) of SMU Chemistry department. An adequate Python translated TAO package empowers a modern scrum process of development that brings new features in future releases of the TAO package. A modern programming language also encourages and facilitate development contribution amoung the broader computational chemistry community, exacerbating the advancement in QM/MM methodologies and development of softwares for various research.
